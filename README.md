# CRM Project – E-Commerce Omni-Channel Customer Experience

## Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
**Goal:** Identify gaps in customer engagement and retention, and define why Salesforce CRM is needed.

### Problem Statement
E-commerce businesses face challenges such as high cart abandonment rates, fragmented customer data across web/app/social channels, poor personalization, and delayed customer support. Customers lack loyalty programs, marketers lack unified insights, and admins cannot measure engagement effectively.

### Why Salesforce?
Salesforce Commerce Cloud + Marketing Cloud provides customizable objects, automation tools, dashboards, and integrations (payment gateways, logistics APIs, SMS/email platforms, inventory systems) that can unify data, personalize experiences, and optimize sales journeys.

### Stakeholders
- **Customers** → Personalized recommendations, order tracking, loyalty points, and offers.  
- **Sales/Marketing Teams** → Track campaigns, improve engagement, and boost conversions.  
- **Customer Support Agents** → Resolve complaints, manage returns, and track interactions.  
- **Logistics Teams** → Manage order fulfilment, returns, and delivery updates.  
- **Admins** → Monitor sales performance, customer lifetime value, and system security.

### KPIs to Improve
- Abandoned cart recovery rate ↑  
- Customer retention & repeat purchase rate ↑  
- Average revenue per customer ↑  
- Customer satisfaction & response time ↓  

### Business Flow Example
Customer browses products → Adds to cart → Leaves without checkout → System triggers abandoned cart flow → Email/SMS sent → Customer completes order → Loyalty points updated → Order synced with logistics → Admin dashboard updated with metrics.
